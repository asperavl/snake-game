Snake Game!

This was a simple project fastlane956, Max948X, and I made for a school project

As the title says, we built a version of snake game using mainly the turtle module of python, along with supplementary modules including mysql-connector, datetime, and more!

The scores are stored in a database created by the database_creation.exe file.

The scores can be:
                    1. Shown either from highest to lowest or latest to earliest
                    2. Exported to a .csv file
                    3. Deleted

The program was designed to be run only on Windows (although we may add support for Linux in the future).

PRE-REQUISITES:
                1. MySQL server should be installed
                2. MySQL-connector should be installed on the system
                3. Python should be installed (any version after version 3 should do)

How to Run the Game:
                1. Run database_creation.exe, once it is done you need not run it again.
                2. Run SnakeGame.exe every time you want to run the game.

NOTE: You must enter the right password for MySQL, otherwise SnakeGame.exe wont be able to save any of the scores!

Have fun setting scores on SnakeGame!
