Snake Game!

This was a simple project fastlane956, Max948X, and I made for a school project

As the title says, we built a version of snake game using mainly the turtle module of python, along with supplementary modules including mysql-connector, datetime, and more!

The scores are stored in a database created by the database_creation.exe file.

The scores can be:
                    1. Shown either from highest to lowest or latest to earliest
                    2. Exported to a .csv file
                    3. Deleted

i wouldnt reccomend downloading and trying it out, its full of spaghetti code
